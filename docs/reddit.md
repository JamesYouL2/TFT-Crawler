TFTSheets is another statistics based TFT tier list like kda.gg and metatft.com. This is based off data from challengers for the past 2 days through the riotgames api.

Here are pros and cons of my project.
Pros:
1. This tier list will keep similar comps together. I think kda.gg and metatft.com split up comps too aggressively. 
There are definitely comps on these sites which should be together but are not. 
I am doing the opposite. 
Basically, I'm not going to show 15+ comps on this tier list. I always plan on showing less comps than there should be. I should only be showing 5-10, depending on the galaxy. 
There are going to be comps that are clustered together and should not be. On the FreeRerolls Galaxy, Cybernetics and Kayle comps are clustered together.
That's the trade off I am accepting in exchange making sure that the comps that this algorithm finds are accurately rated.

2. It's open source. If you have the skills and drive, you can use this project to download your own data and run your own analysis on it. And if you have an improvement on my pretty noobish code, go for it.

3. Like metatft.com, I am splitting up the data by galaxy before clustering. This data shows there are significant differences across galaxies. Cybernetics is not a great comp normally, but in both Neeko and Rank5FoN universes, it's a great one.

Cons:
1. You are not going to find every relevant comp in the game. For example, I don't show Protector comps on FourCost1stCarousel. Also note that I am not clustering every comp and I am not showing those comps.

2. I have almost zero front end skills. This is just not going to look as good as kda.gg or metatft.com.
